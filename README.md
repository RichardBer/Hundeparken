# Hundeparken
Hundeparken Content Management Systems gives the true Hundeparken back to it users by sharing everything needed to run your own "retro park"

*Note: This ParkCMS is for running Hundeparken 2.0. We don't have all required files yet to run Hundeparken 1.0


Tired of seeing your dream game being run down by admins that have no control over their own park?
No problem. We got this. In this repository we are releasing everything you need to start your own. We want everyone to have access to start their own park. 

By releasing the files to everyone, we believe and hopethat someone in the community will take the files and keep working with developing the game. Without the community, the park is dead in a few years anyway.

### Prerequisites
Recommended setup:

[Windows server 2012 R2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2012-r2) - The park also can run on Windows server 2008 R2 but have been edited to run on Windows server 2012 R2, so you might need to fix bugs/errors in the wwwroot

[IIS 8](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-8/installing-iis-8-on-windows-server-2012)

[Yet Another Forum 1.9.5 RC](http://www.yetanotherforum.net/download) - Included in the repository. It might be possible to upgrade it to the newest YAF, but it will require some work and bug fixing

[Microsoft SQL Server 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42299)

[Process Hacker 2](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/downloads.php) - The official method to get the park online is not known, but using this program will do the trick. You always have to restart DR Service Agent & DR Hundepark services in process hacker after the computer have restarted
