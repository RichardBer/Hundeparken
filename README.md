# ParkCMS
Hundeparken Content Management Systems gives the true Hundeparken back to it users by sharing everything needed to run your own "retro park"


Tired of seeing your dream game being run down by strick admins that have no control over their own park?
No problem. We got this. In this repository we are releasing everything you need to start your own. We want everyone to have access to start their own park. 

By releasing the files to everyone, we believe and hopethat someone in the community will take the files and keep working with developing the game. Without the community, the park is dead in a few years anyway.
